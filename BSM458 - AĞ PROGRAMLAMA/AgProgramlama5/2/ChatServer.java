/**
 * A multithreaded chat room server.  When a client connects the
 * server requests a screen name by sending the client the
 * text "SUBMITNAME", and keeps requesting a name until
 * a unique one is received.  After a client submits a unique
 * name, the server acknowledges with "NAMEACCEPTED".  Then
 * all messages from that client will be broadcast to all other
 * clients that have submitted a unique screen name.  The
 * broadcast messages are prefixed with "MESSAGE ".
 *
 * Because this is just a teaching example to illustrate a simple
 * chat server, there are a few features that have been left out.
 * Two are very useful and belong in production code:
 *
 *     1. The protocol should be enhanced so that the client can
 *        send clean disconnect messages to the server.
 *
 *     2. The server should do some logging.
